# dogecoin-dockerfile

A Dockerfile for setting up a container with dogecoind

## This is as yet untested

This is just something I wrote off the cuff based mostly on http://meta.sh/setup/dogecoin/ubuntu. Leave feedback at https://github.com/dogeku/dogecoin-dockerfile/issues if you try this and it doesn't work.
